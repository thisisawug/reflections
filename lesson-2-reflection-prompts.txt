  I made a new master branch for starting version controll of files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
  The staging area is valuable to manage what to commit in a single commit.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
  By comparing the staged files and that of working directory and repository,
  I check what to commit and not, then I can be sure the commit is appropriate.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
  Branches would be helpful to make a new function without changing released
  steady version, furthermore, they also help to make some functions in
  parallel without affecting the master and other functions under construction.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
  They help me to clarify the commit which each branch or commit has made,
  so I can understand reachability of each commit.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
  By merging two branches together, we can integrate changes of two Branches
  into single files.The diagram helps us to clarify when the branch is made and
  merged. In Git, We can refer the diagram of commits by using the command that
  is 'git log --graph --oneline' .

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
